# Ambient lighting

No circuit diagram just yet! :(

But, here is the code for some simple mood lighting I use in my
crib. It happens to work pretty well, though the low-resolution slide
potentiometers I am using made me dumb-down the design a little bit. I
have plenty of plans for additional features, so expect this code to
change dramatically in the coming months.
