* Ambient lighting

No circuit diagram just yet.

But, here is the code for some simple mood lighting I use in my residence. Mood
lighting is based on schema. The following schemas are supported

| Scheme   | Behavior                                            |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| White    | Display white light                                 |
| Echo     | Display the average color detected on the display   |
| Spectrum | Vary wavelength along the entire spectrum over time |

Brightness in all modes is controlled via the brightness potentiometer.
