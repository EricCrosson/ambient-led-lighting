* Ambient lighting
No circuit diagram just yet.

Here is the code for some simple mood lighting I use in my residence. Mood
lighting is based on schema. The following schemas are supported

| Scheme   | Behavior                                            |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| White    | Display white light                                 |
| Echo     | Display the average color detected on the display   |
| Spectrum | Vary wavelength along the entire spectrum over time |

Brightness in all modes is controlled via the brightness potentiometer. The
spectral mode can be configured to scroll from red to violet to red or loop from
red to violet with a discrete jump back to red.
